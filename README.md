Hello!  My name is Tammy Day and I have over 20 years of experience in the Website design and Online marketing field.  

In 1997 I started a website design and marketing company – Virtualtech Website Design and Promotion in Appleton, Wisconsin, to help small business to take advantage of the marketing opportunities found on-line. I grow Virtualtech into a company that provided website design, hosting, search engine optimization, email and social media marketing to over 350 clients in 28 states. After 22 years in business, I sold Virtualtech.

During my time with Virtualtech, I enjoyed answering questions and helping businesses navigate through the maze of online marketing options. Many of my clients said that my positive attitude and professionalism was a refreshing change, and that my straight answers were easy to understand. 

I have decided to get back into the business of Website design and marketing.  My services include Website building & design, Website maintenance, search engines optimization (SEO), and social media marketing.  My preferred platform is Wix, which I have used for several Website projects, including the Website for Literacy Volunteers of Chautauqua County.  I also have experience with WordPress, SquareSpace, and straight HTML. 

With starting over, I do not have many other projects to share with you.  However, here are a few: 

Literacy Volunteers of Chautauqua County – lvccread.org

Happy Tails Veterinary Clinic - facebook.com/happytailsclinic

Tec-Ease – tec-ease.com

Inter-Mec – inter-mec.com

If you will give me a chance with your Website project, I promise that you will not be disappointment in the design and/or marketing of your website, communication, and customer service.  

I am looking forward to working with you. 


Tammy
